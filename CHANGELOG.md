# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-28

### Breaking changes

- `src/build/paths.js` no longer exports path constants. It now exports
  `resolvePaths(projectDir, config)` which resolves all directories relative
  to `projectDir`.
- `src/build/build.js` no longer runs on import. Export `build(projectDir,
  configPath)` and call it explicitly (e.g. from `bin/blyss.js`).
- `src/server/server.js` no longer starts a server on import. Export
  `serve(projectDir, config)` and call it explicitly.

### New features

- **npm package**: published as `@blooniverse/blyss`.
- **CLI**: `bin/blyss.js` provides the `blyss build` and `blyss serve`
  commands; `projectDir` defaults to `process.cwd()`.
- **`package.json`**: `bin`, `files`, and `name` fields set for publishing.
- **`.gitignore`**: `node_modules/` and `public/` excluded from version
  control.
- README updated with installation instructions and site-structure examples.
